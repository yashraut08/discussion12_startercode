            <h2>Why ChatGPT might not be the solution to everything!</h2>

            <div class="paragraph-wrap">
                <p>Although ChatGPT can generate coherent responses based on the provided context, its understanding is limited compared to humans. It may struggle with ambiguous or complex situations that require a deep understanding of context or background information.</p><br>

                <p>Many real-world problems require interdisciplinary approaches and human judgment that go beyond the capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT. Solving complex societal, environmental, or political issues demands collaboration, empathy, and diverse perspectives that AI alone cannot provide.</p>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster Prototyping: ChatGPT can assist web developers by generating code snippets or providing suggestions for HTML and CSS elements based on the desired functionality or design. </li>

                <li>Idea Generation and Problem Solving: Developers can describe their problem or desired outcome, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions or alternative approaches to consider.

        </div>

        <div class="cons box">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Risk of Generating Low-Quality Code: Relying solely on ChatGPT for code generation without human oversight can lead to the creation of not optimal or buggy code, increasing the risk of errors and technical debt. </li>

                <li>Difficulty in Collaborative Debugging: When multiple developers are working on a project, understanding and troubleshooting AI-generated code can pose challenges in collaborative development environments.
